Welcome to QTIS, an app that allows the user to see reviews of cosmetic products simply by scanning its barcode. 

🛠️ The app is done with:

- JS, React Native and Redux to do the front-end. 
- JS, Express and mongoose to do the back-end.
- User authentication done with Passport.
- Everything tested with jest.
